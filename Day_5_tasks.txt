2. What is OOP and its 4 main pillars?

OOP stands for Structured Query Language and is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.

The 4 main pillars of OOP are as follows:-

1. Abstraction - 
 Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world. 
Abstraction is used to describe things in simple terms. 
It's used to create a boundary between the application and the client programs.

2. Encapsulation - 
Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.
It may also refer to the limiting of direct access to some of that data, such as an object's components.

3  Inheritance -
The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class.
Inheritance have its own properties and methods.
 An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.

4. Polymorphism-
Polymorphism is the method in an object-oriented programming language that performs different things as per the object's class, which calls it.
 With the Polymorphism, a message is sent to multiple class objects, and every object responds appropriately according to the properties of the class.



4. What are access modifiers?

Properties and methods can have access modifiers which control where they can be accessed.

1. Public - The property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is default
2. Protected - the property or method can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class
3. Private - the property or method can only be accessed within the class
